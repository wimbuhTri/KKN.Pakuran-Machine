## How This Project Went and Implemented
Because we short on budget the only option is to maximize our laverage on opensource. Using my school server run behind university firewall I run Ngrok client to open port connection so website client can call API connection to this server. Becouse I am broke (sad) that I not able to bought the Ngrok Premium plant to have permanent URL pointing to this server I must do the hevty lifting to build a peace of beacon script that will notify me when the server went down, so I can  notify my fontend-dev fella to replace the URL that point to the server to the new one.
