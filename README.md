## About
Backend machine write in python for website interface serving as webbooks (flask) and API handler

## Goal 
Providing simple HTTP handler responding to API call from cloud hosted frontend solution to serve article generation using five keyword (Five Ws) to help villagers to quickly generate daily article to boost their online present to promote local business

## How This Project Went and Implemented
Because we short on budget the only option is to maximize our laverage on opensource. Using my school server run behind university firewall I run Ngrok client to open port connection so website client can call API connection to this server. Becouse I am broke (sad) that I not able to bought the Ngrok Premium plan to have permanent URL pointing to this server I must do the hevty lifting to build a peace of beacon script that will notify me when the server went down. So I can  notify my fontend fellow to replace the URL that point to the backend server to the new random URL generated by Ngrok. We hit about 3-5 user to serve daily for about 2 week, considering only little number of villagers using smartphone and signal penetration in the vilage we serve is "horable".

## Future Improvement
Integrating this module to GPT2 (or its latest version) to generate more fluid, coherent, and human like article)
